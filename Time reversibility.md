So there's another major difference between the [[@zollner_insight_2020 | Zollner (2020)]] paper and the [[@michaeli_origin_2019 | Naaman (2019)]] paper. Naaman assumes that the time reversal symmetry remains unbroken while the breaking of the time reversal symmetry is the central claim of the Zollner paper. Something to keep in mind. Parity doesn't seem to be a concern with Naaman.
