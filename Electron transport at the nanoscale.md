# Electron transport at the nanoscale
### [Landauer-Buttiker formulation](Landauer-Buttiker%20formulation.md)
#### Assumptions
1. Non-interacting junction #ðŸš© What does that mean??
2. Coherent transport

#### Landauerâ€™s principle
Landauerâ€™s principle is that the erasure of information requires energy. 
NkTln2
#### fuel value of information
The energy that you can extract. NkTln2 without violating the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics
