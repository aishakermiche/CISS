### Biological Homochirality remains a mystery
The D-enantiomer for sugar and the L-enantiomer for amino acids are exclusively used for all living organisms, a phenomena known as homochirality. Why nature chose these specific enantiomers is unknown, the current consensus identifies several contributing factors. One is that early organisms adopted this enantioselectivity, which was selected for and propagated for all subsequent organisms along the evolutionary timeline. Another identifies polarized light and electroweak decay as forces selectively degrading one isomer over the other. Another contribution autocatalysis, in which one isomer stimulates and propagates it's own production. None of these theories are complete.
