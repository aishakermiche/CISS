#### Overview
Unlike in man-made electronic devices, where electron transport is facilitated through metals and semimetals, biological systems rely on electron transport through insulating molecules with minimum heat dissipation.[^1]

The chiral induced spin selectivity effect (CISS) is a phenomenon in which electron spin polarization is produced as a result of chiral electrode molecule transfer processes. This is usually done through the transmission of electrons through a chiral environment. [^2]

#### Characteristics of CISS
1. non-equilibrium effect, requiring electron transfer through chiral molecules 
2. requires large spin-orbit coupling (SOC) enhancement
3. flipping the chirality of the molecule flips the polarization
4. as of current evidence, polarization increases with increasing length of the chiral molecule.

Questions: 
1. Why is the transmission through helical molecules larger than expected?
2. What causes then robust CISS?
