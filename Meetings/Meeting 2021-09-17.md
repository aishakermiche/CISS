- define [[coherence and decoherence]]
- is it really [[spin filtering capabilities of chiral molecules | spin filtering]]???
- if its a spin filter, for quantum computing it is worthless. 
- [[Experimental Results]]
- is the electron allowed to delocalize in the helical path. 
- ballistic vs delocalized vs tunnelling. 
- see if similarity between ciss and condensed matter
- instead of a linear system, consider a linear chain
- dft transport
