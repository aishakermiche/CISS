Ciss Effect - chiral induced spin selectivity effect
In presence of chiral potential, only one spin is passed through like a filter
Models available 
Only half a model available. 
Study effect in simulations

How is spin affected in different 

Build a model, code and tool from the ground up
MUST INCORPORATE SPIN
DFT-SPIN 

Introduce spin-orbit coupling (important in the CISS effect)
Need to choose a molecule of interest 
Helixical carbon atoms -directional helix

Concerns:
Need to spend some time everyday looking at funding (and thinking about alternative models to contemporary research)
Need to spend time reading and understanding
Need to find creative ways of sharing my insights with others.
