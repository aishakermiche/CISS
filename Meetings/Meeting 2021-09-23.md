To address questions from [[Meeting 2021-09-23 | last meeting]]...

###. 1 [[Application#CISS as a spin filter - does it decohere]]

##### 2. [[Experimental Results]]
##### 3. Does the electron delocalize as it is conducted through the chiral molecule? 
It appears that the linear momentum along the helical trajectory of the chiral molecule is key to the description of the effect. 

##### 4. [[Simulation Methods]]

- The coupling between the spin and the linear momentum is widely considered to be the origin of electron transfer, so models have to consider the ballistic motion of the electron
- the problem with most theoretical models are that they predict only a small spin polarization 


What happens to electrons that go through with the wrong spin. 
- Since traditional DFT methods ignore spin, typically some semi-empirical approach with a Hamiltonian model is used to model the system. 
- Hamiltonian models usually are simplified to a single electron traveling along a helical path

- Most interesting model provided by Zollner et al (2020)
- Simply model - ideal carbon helix
