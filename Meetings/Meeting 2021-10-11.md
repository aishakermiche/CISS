#### Tasks from [[Meeting 2021-10-04 | last week]]
- [ ] Contact condensed physics group 
- [ ] Use M-sparc to learn basics of spin-dft
		- [[?]] Can you modify the form of the Hamiltonian 
- [ ] perform full spin-dft analysis of simple ~molecular junction in nwchem

#### Conceptual tasks
- [ ] Learn how to perform basic KS-DFT simulations using M-SPARC. 
	- not sure how to encode a hybrid potential, as the option isn't presented in the M-SPARC system. 
- [ ] Modeling single electron confined to a linear path moving along a linear potential
	- This is done analytically. Parity and time-symmetry preservation is a point of contention [See talk here](https://youtu.be/SOXCJ1tQB6g) Skip to [[41:49]] for mention of spin-selectivity This talk supports that time reversal symmetry is

	- ***IMPORTANT***: Since spin-orbit coupling itself is a time reversible process, *unitary must be broken somehow for the effect to take space*. 
- [ ] Understand quantitative measure to determine if transport is in the tunneling regime
- [ ] Find ways to measure both (1) degree of spin polarization (2) coherence (3) charge transport regime

#### Progress
- [[Time reversibility]]
- At this point, I should able to build a simple 4 carbon chain, but
	-  I'm not sure how to modify the hamiltonian to apply a linear dipole potential along the length of the molecule. 
	-  I'm also not sure how to choose a pseudopotential and a cross correlation potential. 
	- Also don't know how to find the initial coordinates
- Need to look and the Landauer-Buttiker tunneling regime mention in the Goodnick [[cite]] textbook. That is what Zollner uses to model the electron transport. Naaman on the other hand does not clearly specific a mode for the tunneling regime.
- I still don't know how to quantify time reversibility symbolically inside of the hamiltonian. If time is irreversible, that means information is destroyed, meaning that it is not suitable for quantum computation. [[Application]]
- Tasks for next day:
	- [ ] Run simple 4 carbon atom chain without a linear potential (find way to visualize results)
	- [ ] Go through analytical solution to schrodinger equation and compare to Naaman's results
	- [ ] Watch through lectures explaining time reversibility, electron transport through landauer tunneling (also go through goodnick textbook)
