[[Time reversibility]] is a large point of contention.  

#### Nonen's functions

#### ballistic conduction
From [[@ferry_transport_2009]]: 
At the mesoscale, electrons can travel a significant distance without scattering. This is called *ballistic transport*, since at this scale, the electrons trajectory follows Newton's second law of motion. Ballistic transport, since it is unscattered, also remains coherent. In bulk electron transport, electrons typically encounter impurities that scatter (change it's momentum) where scattering is local and instantaneous. 

The mental image here is confusing because *ballistic* recalls the notion of a classical billiard ball moving in space instead of a wave function. For now I will just take the definition as the region in while the qunatum coherence length $l_\psi$ is greater than the length of the device $L$.
$l_\psi >>> L$


Most importantly^[![[@ferry_transport_2009#^ecfb3d]]] :
> " the size can be small compared to the phase-breaking length, which nominally describes the distance over which the electron wave's phase is destroyed by some process. In this case, the phase of the particle becomes important, and many **phase-interference effects begin to appear in the characteristic conductance of the material.**"


[[?]] Localization meaning? wave like motion? hopping, tunneling?
