*Conductance is Transmission!*

In summary the LIB (or just Landauer approach), calculates the current $I_{RL}$ by integrating over a transmission function:
$I_{RL} = \frac{e}{h} \int_{E-\frac{eV}{2}}^{E+\frac{eV}{2}} T_{RL}(E) dE$
The transmission function is obtained:
$T_{RL} = Tr[\bf{\Gamma_L G \Gamma_R G^{\dagger}}]$

The central Green's function can be determine by:
$\bf{G} = \frac{1}{E\bf{S_C} - \bf{H_C} - \bf{\Sigma_L} - \bf{\Sigma_R}}$

Definitions:
$H_C$: Effective single particle Hamiltonian matrix of the central region, obtained from electronic structure theory such as Hartree-Fock, semiempirical methods, or tight binding models. 
$S_C$: Overlap matrix of the centra region
$\Sigma_L, \Sigma_R$: self-energies of the left and right electrodes
