#### Goals

1.  Determine if CISS is coherent and can it be used for quantum information applications
2.  Characterize topological properties of chiral molecules and understand if topology plays a role in electron transport through chiral molecules.

#### Objectives

1.  Build tool to study effect in simulations
2.  Introduce spin-orbit coupling
3.  Find sample molecule of interest (directional helices)
4.  Present theoretical model for the given effect
