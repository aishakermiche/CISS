Basic experiments:
1. Light experiment on gold, flying through chiral molecule, scattering experiments - more straightforward showing the effect 
	1. Different intensity depending on the light being shined on the molecule
	2. poor conductance might be a reason why the effect is large
	3. ***THINKING ABOUT SCATTERING AND EVERNESCENT STATES***
	4. There will be different penetration depths of different spins. 
	5. Cannot have filtering without polarization or polarization without spin. We cannot preserve the polarization of the spin. 
	6. What is being meant by no back scattering 
	7. spinor effect "like that"
	8. ***THIS IS MEASUREMENT SYSTEM. [Measurement as a way of seeing](Measurement%20as%20a%20way%20of%20seeing.md) [measurement as gaze](measurement%20as%20gaze) ***
	9. ***NONLINEAR EFFECT. INTERACTION. IT HAS TO INTERACT WITH PHONONS***
	10. ***INTERACTING SYSTEMS ALWAYS LEAD TO DECOHERENCE***
	11. ***AB INTERFEROMETRY IS VERY HARD TO EXECUTE***
	12. ***GOING TO VERY LOW TEMPERATURE MIGHT HELP***
	13. ***COOPER PAIRS**
	14. multiple path realizability - might be too distracting!!!
2. Molecule junction experiment, classical transport experiment
