### Questions

- [ ] Understanding mathematical formulations of [[Spin-Orbit Coupling (SOC)]]
- [ ] SPIN-DFT paper
- [ ]  Does this only transpot electrons but also does is govern ion transport as well?
- [ ] I'm new to tunneling based transport, so I'd like to try understanding the intuiton of the electron transport in terms of models I know like:
	- [ ] geometry of hybridization within a chiral molecule, before running the simulations
	- [ ] How do we go about modeling noise in biological environments?
