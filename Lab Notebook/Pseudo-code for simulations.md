`` % Pseudo-code for CISS interferometry simulation
% The goal of this simulation is to examine the interference effects occuring
% in a chiral nanojunction between two gold leads to characterize the coherence
% and propose a mechanism for the chiral induced spin-selectivity effects

% The main theorotical considerations in determining a mechanism for the CISS effect are
	% Symmetry (time parity)
	% Leakages (interference)
	% Non-equilibrium effects
	% Noise (stochastic resonance)
	% Topology
 
% There are several different key measurement outcomes that I am interested in:
	% Finding the band gap of the chiral topological structure 
	% Modeling the conductance with the Green's Function and the Laundauer Formalism
	% Using DFT to determine the 
	% Questioning assumptions of the analytical models
	% How do you determine causality and mechanism if all models provide sufficient prediction of the spin polarization? 

% The concrete tasks are:
	% Make a MATLAB code that can do quick exchanging of model assumptions and measure the conductance and spin polarization of electrons through a chiral molecule.
	% Expand this to be able to account for leakages, non-equilibrium effects, and noise. 

% Procedure
	% Build a model from the literature every couple of days. 
	% Translate main theoretical insights into notes
	% Integrate what you learned back into a generalized tool.
