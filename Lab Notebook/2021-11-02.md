*Goal:* Want to try reproducing analytical solution from Michaeli et al. (2019)^[![](@miller_chiral_2018.md#^3b7aab)]. Want to try using M-SPARC to run DFT simulation on a carbon nanowire. 
Learning goals: Read DFT textbook to find spin DFT simulation example with explanation. 
Results: 
- Began coding constants and parameterization of Michaeli model in MATLAB. **Didn't understand the discretization or how to plot and visualize the results
- Ran M-SPARC model for simple 4 atom carbon wire. **Still don't know how to modify potential in Kohn Sham equations manually using the software. 
- Finished broad overview of major equations and assumptions in DFT, spin DFT, and time dependent DFT. 
- Learned connection between Kohn-Sham DFT equations and band gap
- Fundamental assumption of density function theory is that total energy can be determined from the electron density and the spin density. 
- Not sure who audience of note library is for

Tasks for tomorrow:
- [ ] [exchange correlation function for spin DFT calculations](exchange%20correlation%20function%20for%20spin%20DFT%20calculations)
- [ ]  [pseudopotential for carbon nanowire](pseudopotential%20for%20carbon%20nanowire)
- [ ] [analytical solution](analytical%20solution)
