[[+CISS]] Lab Notebook

Goal:
Record of Simulations:
Discussion:
- [[@zollner_insight_2020]] - taking notes
	- Coherent tunneling is the dominant transport mechanism for oligopeptides, while discription of segments of DNA requires the inclusion of incoherent transport. 
	- [[Landauer-Buttiker formulation]]
	- Two component KS-DFT used here, meaning all spins are either pointing up or down. 
Need to understand [[tight binding models]]
- [[@gutierrez_spin-selective_2012]] and [[@medina_continuum_2015]] - tight binding models with ad hoc approximations

Open questions:
- What is the difference between time reversal symmetry in terms of quantum mechanics and in terms of thermodynamics? Are they analogous, the same, refer to two difference phenomena entirely?
- The main objective here is to have a precise proposal for Amartya this monday.
