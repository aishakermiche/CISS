Discussion:
- Since CISS is a non-equilibrium process, maybe DFT is not appropriate? Or we need to use TD-DFT
- Obtained band gap for analytical model. Still trouble shooting units for plot
- Scattering matrix is a *unitary* operation. 
Tomorrow:
- Want to look at the first-principle conductance of DNA to see how tunneling is a result of **geometrical rather than electronic structure properties**. That way we won't have to worry about any added complexity.
- Want to dig into the weeds of the Landauer Buttiker formalism. Both these things can give insights on how to design experiments.
