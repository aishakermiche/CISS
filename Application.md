#### Application
This ability to manipulate and control spin through charge transfer processes can be exploited in the development of spintronic  devices, with implications for the transfer and storage of information in quantum computing applications. 

Chiral molecules can filter and preserve spin at room temperatures, and they can replace ferromagnets as spin injectors. Typically, this kind of spin injection and spin manipulation is performed by materials having large [Spin-Orbit Coupling (SOC)](Spin-Orbit%20Coupling%20(SOC).md). Given that organic molecules are not magnetic or have a large SOC, it is surprising that the CISS effect is capable of performing the spin-filtering observed.[^1]

In addition, one of the main challenges in developing nano-scale electronic devices is the problem of heating. Biological systems are capable of transport electrons across nanometer scales without causing temperature changes that would denature the constituent proteins. Transport via quantum tunneling through organic molecules has an unexpectedly high efficiency in biological systems, making it an area of interest for developing new information technology applications.

##### CISS as a spin filter - does it decohere?

In order for the CISS effect to be relevant to quantum information applications, the chiral molecule would have to act either as a quantum wire or a quantum switch, meaning that it preserves the complex phase difference of the superposition of spins. If acting as a quantum wire, it would have to preserve the state of the system without experiencing decoherence. If the CISS effect is purely spin filtering, it then destroys the complex phase of the superposition, making it suitable for classical spintronic applications but not suitable for quantum computing. 

Majority of papers reviewed use the language "spin-filtering" to describe the CISS effect. Some descriptions seem contradictory. Experimental results for Naaman et al. (2020) from the Weizmann Institute specify that the effect is as a passive spin-filter, but not spin flipping, since there suggesting that chiral molecules do not have a spin-manipulation effect, they simply reject electrons that are destabilized by the internal magnetic field. 

Another remaining question is why chiral molecules do not act as *perfect* spin filters. [?](?)
