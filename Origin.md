#### Origin
Intuitively, from an understanding of classical physics, we would think that the chiral molecule itself acts as a solenoid where the induced magnetic field can interact with electron and induce polarization. However, the field generated inside a molecular solenoid is much too small for this to happen. [^1]

So perhaps it could be the quantum version of the solenoid field, chiral induced spin orbit coupling, could explain it, but still the order of magnitude is far too small. 

Theoretical approaches so far have assumed a close connection between chirality and spin-orbit interaction, which is supported by DFT calculations. [^2].
