Alwan and Dubi[^1] believe that the effect originates based on the interplay between spin-orbit interactions in the electrode, the chirality of the molecule inducing a solenoid field, and the spin-transfer torque of the molecule.

Chiral molecules do not contain heavy atoms that are associated with ferromagnetism, so the effect must result from symmetry breaking associated with the electronic structure of chiral molecules or external field. 

It is now broadly accepted that CISS is related to [[Quantum tunnelling in chiral molecules | quantum tunneling]].
