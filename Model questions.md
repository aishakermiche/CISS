1. What are the fundamental assumptions in constructing the hamiltonian
2. Were you able to reproduce their results
3. What insights can we carry over into our proposed model.
4. What is the role of the exchange correlation potential
5. What is the difference between periodic structure and resonance
6. Any relevant definitions/concept notes
7. Can you specify the language between the experimental studies and the toy models (could the result be due to a condensation effect like Daniel said. Is this 1D conduction or a collection into a 2D layer)
8. What does spin polarization mean in the context of the model
