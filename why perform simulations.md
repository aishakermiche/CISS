Physicists usually develop equations that are impossible to solve numerically. The Schr√∂dinger equation is one such equations, so physicists must rely on numerical solutions and degrees of approximation. In addition, experiments are not only expensive and difficult to carry out, but they also don't provide interpretive insight into why a certain arrangement of systems is preferable over another. Performing simulations can allow microscopic models to provide insight into the underlying mechanisms governing the material. This can also provide bench marks for verifying approximated theories.[^1]

"To turn the basic information obtained from solving the Schrodinger equation into relevant engineering information, one needs to , first, understand quantitatively the microscopic phenomena that control macroscopic engineering property so that the problem can be translated into computable quantities, and, second, understand the technology to ensure that the right problem is solved. " - Gerbrand Ceder [^2]
