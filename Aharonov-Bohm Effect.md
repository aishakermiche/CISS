The Aharonov-Bohm effect describes a phase shift that occurs in an electrically charged particle traveling normal to a solenoid. 

If a particle moves in a region where the magnetic field is 0, but the magnetic potential is not equal to 0:
$\vec{B} = \vec{\nabla}\times\vec{A}=0, A \neq 0$

The particle will experience a phase shift, even the magnetic field is confined to the interior of the solenoid, so the magnetic field and the electric field in the region of the charged particle should be 0. 

$\Delta \phi = \frac{e\phi}{\hbar}$
- Classical physics: Lorentz force:
	- $m \frac{d^2r}{dt^2}= -e[E+\frac{v}{c}\times B]$

- Quantum Physics - Schrodinger equation
	- $(H_o + V)\Psi = \frac{i\hbar \partial \Psi}{\partial t}$

If the value of potential functions is not supposed to matter, and only the fields have a physical effect, then why is this occur?
