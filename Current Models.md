## Main themes of interest
- Evanescent states, different penetration depth of the electron
- **Multiple Realizability**
- Coupling between quantum effects at the nanoscale and classical thermodynamic effects in the environmental bath. 
- Symmetry analysis
- Breaking of time reversibility
- Aharonov bohm interferometry
- CISS effect as a measurement operator
- Molecular junction - are the leads a source of the magnetization
- Stochastic resonance
- spatial resonance
