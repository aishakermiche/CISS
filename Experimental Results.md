 Hermitian

## Key objectives
We want to know how current evidence supports the following:
1. The CISS effect is a spin-filtering, rather than a spin transformer
2. The CISS effect can act as a perfect spin filter
3. The CISS effect prevents back scattering of the current

## Timeline
- Ray et al. (1999) [[cite]] - first observed asymmetric scattering of polarized electrons by organized organic films of chiral molecules
	- Polarized beams of electrons release from gold substrate, passed through 5 layers of L-stearoyl lysine ([[?]] how did the hydrophobic/hydrophillic orientation affect the results)

- Gohler et al. and Xie et al. - using photoemission and AFM-based transport probes

Electron transport through chiral molecules appear to correspond probabilistically to the spin polarization of the injected current (   ) 

-[[?]] Is the charge polarization of the chiral molecule induced by the incoming electron.
