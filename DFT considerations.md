#### spin DFT calculations 1D assumption
When solving multi-body systems using DFT, there are two options for parameterizing the spins of the constituent electrons. One is **collinear** in while spins are aligned up or down like a single electron, while **non-collinear** calculations contained many different spin orientations jumbled together. Non-collinear spin DFT calculations are far more computationally expensive. #ðŸš© Iâ€™m pretty sure that the superposition can be investigated through a collinear parameterization, but I would have to double check if this is a reasonable assumption.

#### Density functional theory is not designed for non-equilibrium phenomena
#ðŸš© If thatâ€™s the case, how do we compute a non-equilibrium process like the CISS effect?
