The challenge of measuring the quantum state of an electron is that the superposition interacts with many other particles on its way to the detector, changing the phase $\theta$ of coefficients slightly as it travels on its way towards the detector.

Decoherence converts quantum probabilities to classical probabilities. 

$\ket{\psi} = a_1 \ket{1} + a_2\ket{2}$

$a_1a_1^{*} + a_2a_2^{*} = 1$

$\ket{\psi} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}\ket{1} + \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}e^{i\theta}\ket{2}$

$\rho = |\Psi \times \Psi| \begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{2} a_1a_2^{*}$
By the time the particle reaches the detector, phase difference between the superpositions is averages to equal zero. These little random changes of the phase destroy the wave functions ability to form an interference pattern with itself. A wave with a well defined phase that can interfere with itself is called "coherent". 

The question for [[+CISS]] is whether or not transport of the electron through a chiral medium causes the wave function of the electron to decohere. Without the wave properties governing the probabilities of the superposition the effect is no long useful to exploit for quantum information applications.

This does NOT give us the state of when the particle is measured. This only partially solves the measurement problem. It explains why we do not observe quantum effects for large object. But it does not tell you why the wave function collapses upon measurement.
