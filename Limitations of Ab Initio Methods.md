All methods determining a material or chemical structure starting from the basic theorems of quantum mechanics are callled ab initio (or first principle methods). [^1]

### Molecular Dynamics
Molecular dynamics simulations relying on modeling the interaction between atoms using an empirically derived interatomic potentials, which are used as the governing model of all behavior. While this has an advantage over first principle methods, since the behavior of individual system is rigorously validated by empirical methods, the problem is that it is not transferable. Interatomic potentials limit the accuracy of transferability of the potential to different environments it was not designed for. It also does not provide any account for the electronic structure of the material. Disordered or complex materials are also difficult to treat. [^1]

- [ ] How do we turn a stochastic quantum system into a deterministic one? What is the formulation mathematically? How do we remove the uncertainty inherint to the quantum system? 
- [ ] Is determinism is the fundamental assumption of ab initio methods?
- [ ] Is the potential energy term in the schrodinger equation something that is empirically derived? Like in molecular dynamics? 
- [ ] How does the hatree-fock approximation account for (or ignore) spin?
